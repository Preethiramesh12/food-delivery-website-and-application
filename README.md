A software requirements specification (SRS) is a description of a software system to be developed.It is modeled after businessrequirements specification (CONOPS), 
also known as a stakeholder requirements specification (StRS). The software requirements specification lays out functional and non-functional requirements, 
and it may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide .Software requirements specification establishes the basis
for an agreement between customers and contractors or suppliers on how the software product should function. Software requirements specification is a rigorous
assessment of requirements before the more specific system design stages, and its goal is to reduce later redesign. It should also provide a realistic
basis for estimating product costs, risks, and schedules .Used appropriately, software requirements specifications can help prevent software project failure.
To begin with, the purpose of the document is presented and its intended audience outlined. Subsequently, the scope of the project specified by the document is given
with a particular focus on what the resultant software will do and the relevant benefits associated with it.The nomenclature used throughout 
the SRS is also offered. To conclude, a complete document overview is provided to facilitate increased reader comprehension and navigation.
